# Are we creating a toolpath API?

A thought that occurred to me was that Vespidae could be a codebase / API for creating custom CAM software. I actually think that this could be a really valuable thing for a lot of people in the machine building and digital fabrication community. Does any good alternatives exist here? The Vespidae API would take care of all the scary stuff like mesh slicing, path planning algorithms, etc. A good way to think about this could be how Clipper is setup. Clipper forces you to convert your polygons into *Clipper polygons*. Then it lets you feed these polygons into Clippers stack and use all the functionality of Clipper. 

Right now you are developing this in Rhino / Grasshopper. Thats not really a problem and it just helps you visualize things. As Vespidae matures I think the real value of it lies in the VespidaeTools class. A valuable thing to keep in mind as we more forward is how Vespidae could be a made available for other languages, for example javascript. 

*Some loose notes on this subject:* 

- Think about interacting with Vespidae without Grasshopper but through the Rhino terminal. What functionallity do you need to add to enable this? What does this interaction look like? 
- There are a couple of commercial toolpath/CAM apis. Notably [Fusion 360's api](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=GUID-7F3F9D48-ED88-451A-907C-82EAE67DEA93) or [dyndrite's](https://www.dyndrite.com/technology/vector-toolpathing-api). They are however behind subscription walls.

Searching through the web and reading through different forums there doesnt seem to exist a proper open-source library for working with CAM. 

# Is there a need for a new open-source geometry kernel? 

*Vespidae is developed on top of McNeel's/Rhino's geometry kernel. What would my options be if I wanted to go outside of this kernel?*

Wikipedia keeps an overview of existing geometry kernels [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling_kernel). Not sure how complete this is. 

# CAD model to battery printing exercise

This is a reflection based no a conversation I had with Leo McElroy the other day where he made some interesting points as I was describing the Vespidae project and the collaboration with Vinh. *Why cant we model battery geometry in CAD and create toolpaths from this model?* . Expanding on this, I guess this breaks down to resolution. CAD doesnt really give us the opportunity to control how material is structured within the boundtry of the surface geometry. I might be using the wrong terminonlogies here, but bare with me. I think its correct to say that a CAD model gives us a representation of the surface geometry of whatever we are modelling. It does not howver give us a explicit representaion of how material is shaped witin this geometry. As we move over to a CAM program, the CAM program is concerned with how we can cut away material from some stock material to approximate the surface geometry as closely as possible. If its a 3D printing scheme the CAM program, or slicing program, does provide options for how the internal structure is shaped, but with what I would call a high-level granularity. In the battery case the inside structure, and how it's layed down, is really important as we are after all talking about conductive circuitry. 

This is totally a nich√© case, but it does highlight a rather important point I think. *give more examples of cases where more low level control and granularity makes sense.*

# Tools for generating infills and tools for sorting seems to be the thing 

Just a quick note about what seems to be the most useful features so far in Vespidae when working with Vinh. Number one, Vespidae needs to provide semi-automatic tools for creating toolpath curves. What I mean by semi-automatic is that these tools should automate and make it easy to for example create infill lines from polygons. I'm curious how important the infill patterns will become as we start with real batteries. 

# Comprehensible Machines

We a look at an interaction with a machine as lying between two endpoints: On the one side we find an interaction that relies on a pure human-to-robot interaction. The robot is guided or given instructions by the human in a purely physical context. The human interacts with the robots almost like it would interact with a human. It gives the robot instructions by either showing or telling the robot how to do stuff. This interaction is a hot topic in the robotics research community and often goes under the banne *co-bots.* On the other side of this spectrum we find a workflow that we typically see in digital fabrication. A computer is used as a middle-ground between the human and the robot. All instructions are pre-planned and generated in the computer and transformed into machine executable actions that is then given to the robot. 

The sweet spot is presumable somewhere in the middle. A problem I find in machine interaction is a persons ability to understand or predict what a machine is about to do and how the given instructions are perceived by the machine.

# CAM granularity
What granularity does a CAM program need? How much should be automated and how should be left as a manual job?
